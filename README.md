How To Design Programs/BSL+ISL scripts
I am on my journey of learning to program. Initially I started like most people thinking I just needed to learn a programming language. So I briefly tried python but I did not enjoy it much. Then I learned some Go and R... but I still do not know how to program. I am at it again this time with a course called How to Design Programs. And what I have learned studying GIS and these couple programming languages is making it less intimidating. Unlike my other repository- this will be only Racket scripts.
